        The building was transformed by Kobi Karp Architecture and Interior Design to create 
        an arts space that will host a year-round schedule of talks, performances, workshops, 
        and family programmes, as well as event rentals.
        Approximately 31,000 square feet (2,880 square metres) of flexible installation space 
        can be custom-built and adapted to the specificities of experiential art installations, 
        while 6,000 square feet (560 square metres) is dedicated to flexible event space.</p>
